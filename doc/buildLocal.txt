Server setup:
1. Install some sort of http server
an easy option for windows is to install wamp: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/  
for others, such as linux/mac install apache: https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi 

2. Download python 3.7
  a) Use python's "pip install" to install these dependencies (ex: "pip install packagenamehere")

note, the number after the == is what version should be installed, though if you have no errors with "pip install packagenamehere"
then don't worry about these version numbers

3. Download the entire repository from https://github.com/ElevenLe/SailBoat
	recommended to change the key in app.py and server.py from the current value, can get a random key by using this command in python
	Fernet.generate_key()
	
4. Make sure the http server is running (either wamp or apache should be running), then navigate a terminal window to the directory containing app.py and run "python app.py"
At this point, you should see some text telling you the server is running. 
To test if the server is working correctly, type "localhost" in a web browser's address field.
(note, can change port number from app.py)

NOTE: designed for a maximum of 6 rooms, if using more than that change numRooms in app.py, and also add in data.txt a new line containing only a number (ex: 0)
If you don't do this, the program will ignore any attempts to send data to the new room.
