Server setup:
1. Install some sort of http server
easy option for windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/  
for others: https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi 

2. Download python 3.7
  a) Use python's "pip install" to install these dependencies (ex: "pip install packagename")

note, the number after the == is what version should be installed, though if you have no errors with "pip install packagename"
then don't worry about these version numbers
