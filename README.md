# SailBoat

---------- Raspberry pi setup for sending data to server ------------
Anything marked maybe might not be necessary / may already be installed
Run on raspberry pi
(maybe sudo apt-get install python-3.6
             sudo apt-get install pip)
pip install requests
(maybe pip install flask)

Monitoring script should import postScript.py, and run postData(somedata) when we want to send the new data to the server
format of somedata TBD, anything that can be converted to a string will work at the moment
